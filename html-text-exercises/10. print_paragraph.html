    <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and
        typesetting industry.</p>
    <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Lorem Ipsum has been the
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled
        it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
        Ipsum passages,</p>
    <p style="font-family: 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Arial Narrow', Arial, sans-serif;">and more recently with desktop
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
